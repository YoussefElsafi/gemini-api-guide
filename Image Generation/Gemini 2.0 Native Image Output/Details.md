      Gemini API: Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental Text-and-Image Generation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW:

The Gemini API provides access to Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental, a model capable of generating both text and images, often interleaved within a single response. This allows for rich, multimodal outputs, conversational image editing, and contextual image generation within longer text sequences.  It's particularly well-suited for scenarios where the generated image needs to be directly relevant to the surrounding text or a provided image input.

KEY CAPABILITIES:

*   **Interleaved Text and Image Generation:** Produces outputs that combine text and images seamlessly.  Useful for creating illustrated documents, blog posts, recipes, etc.
*   **Contextual Image Generation:** Generates images that are highly relevant to the provided text prompt and/or input images. Leverages world knowledge and reasoning.
*   **Conversational Image Editing:** Allows for iterative image modification through natural language instructions in a chat-like setting.  The model maintains context across multiple turns.
*   **Multimodal Input:**  Accepts both text and image inputs, enabling tasks like image-based question answering, caption generation, and image transformations.
*   **SynthID Watermarking:** All generated images are digitally watermarked with SynthID.  Images generated in AI Studio also include a visible watermark.

GENERATING IMAGES (Python Example):

1.  **Install the SDK:** (Assumed to be installed - `pip install google-genai`)

2.  **Import Libraries:**
    ```python
    from google import genai
    from google.genai import types
    from PIL import Image  # For image handling
    from io import BytesIO # For handling image bytes
    ```

3.  **Instantiate the Client and Generate Content:**
    ```python
    client = genai.Client()

    contents = ('Hi, can you create a 3d rendered image of a pig '
                'with wings and a top hat flying over a happy '
                'futuristic scifi city with lots of greenery?')

    response = client.models.generate_content(
        model="models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp",  # The Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp model
        contents=contents,
        config=types.GenerateContentConfig(response_modalities=['Text', 'Image'])
    )

    for part in response.candidates[0].content.parts:
      if part.text is not None:
        print(part.text)  # Print any text output
      elif part.inline_data is not None:
        image = Image.open(BytesIO(part.inline_data.data))
        image.show()  # Display the image (you might save it instead)
    ```

GEMINI 2.0 FLASH EXP MODEL PARAMETERS (`generate_content()`):

*   **`model` (Required):** Specifies the model to use.  For Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental, this should be `"models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp"`.
*   **`contents` (Required):**  The input to the model.  This can be a string (for text-only prompts), a tuple of strings and images (for multimodal input), or a more complex structure for multi-turn conversations (see documentation).
*   **`config` (Optional):**  Allows you to configure the generation process.  Key options include:
    *   `response_modalities`: A list specifying the desired output modalities.  Can include `'Text'` and `'Image'`. This is important for explicitly requesting image output.
*   **Watermarking:** All generated images include a non-visible digital SynthID watermark, and in AI Studio, a visible watermark.

INPUT MODES AND EXAMPLE PROMPTS:

*   **Text to Image:**
    *   Prompt: `"Generate an image of the Eiffel tower with fireworks in the background."`
*   **Text to Image(s) and Text (Interleaved):**
    *   Prompt: `"Generate an illustrated recipe for a paella."`
*   **Image(s) and Text to Image(s) and Text (Interleaved):**
    *   Prompt: (With an image of a furnished room) `"What other color sofas would work in my space? can you update the image?"`
*   **Image Editing (Text and Image to Image):**
    *   Prompt: `"Edit this image to make it look like a cartoon"`
    *   Prompt:  `[image of a cat] + [image of a pillow] + "Create a cross stitch of my cat on this pillow."`
*   **Multi-turn Image Editing (Chat):**
    *   Prompts: `[upload an image of a blue car.] "Turn this car into a convertible." "Now change the color to yellow."`

TEXT PROMPT LANGUAGES:

*   For best performance, use the following languages: EN, es-MX, ja-JP, zh-CN, hi-IN.

LIMITATIONS:

*   **Audio/Video Input:** Image generation does not currently support audio or video inputs.
*   **Inconsistent Image Generation:**  The model may sometimes output only text.  Explicitly requesting image generation in your prompt (e.g., "generate an image") can help.
*   **Interrupted Generation:** The model might stop generating partway through.  Try again or use a different prompt.
*   **Text-to-Image Order:**  For generating text descriptions *before* an image, it's often best to generate the text first and then request the image based on that text.

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:

*   **Gemini API Documentation:**  Refer to the official Gemini API documentation for complete details on input formats, parameters, and error handling.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:

*   Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental is a multimodal model capable of generating both text and images, often interleaved.
*   It excels at contextual image generation and conversational image editing.
*   The `generate_content()` function is used for interacting with the model.
*   Be mindful of the limitations, particularly regarding inconsistent image generation.  Explicitly requesting images is often necessary.
*   Supported languages for optimal performance are: EN, es-MX, ja-JP, zh-CN, hi-IN.
