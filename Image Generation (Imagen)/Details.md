                Gemini API: Imagen 3 Text-to-Image Generation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW:

The Gemini API provides access to Imagen 3, Google's state-of-the-art text-to-image model.  Imagen 3 offers significant improvements in image quality, detail, lighting, artifact reduction, and text rendering compared to previous models.  It excels at understanding natural language prompts and generating images in various styles and formats.

KEY CAPABILITIES:

*   **Superior Image Quality:** Generates images with enhanced detail, richer lighting, and fewer distracting visual artifacts.
*   **Natural Language Understanding:**  Effectively interprets prompts written in natural, conversational language.
*   **Style and Format Versatility:** Can produce images in a wide range of artistic styles and aspect ratios.
*   **Improved Text Rendering:**  Renders text within images more accurately and clearly than previous models.

GENERATING IMAGES (Python Example):

1.  **Install the SDK:** (Assumed to be installed - `pip install google-genai`)

2.  **Import Libraries:**
    ```python
    from google import genai
    from google.genai import types
    from PIL import Image  # For image handling
    from io import BytesIO # For handling image bytes
    ```

3.  **Instantiate the Client and Generate Images:**
    ```python
    client = genai.Client(api_key='GEMINI_API_KEY')

    response = client.models.generate_images(
        model='imagen-3.0-generate-002',  # The Imagen 3 model name
        prompt='Fuzzy bunnies in my kitchen',  # Your text prompt
        config=types.GenerateImagesConfig(
            number_of_images=4,  # Number of images to generate (1-4)
        )
    )

    for generated_image in response.generated_images:
        image = Image.open(BytesIO(generated_image.image.image_bytes))
        image.show()  # Display the image (you might save it instead)
    ```

IMAGEN MODEL PARAMETERS (`generate_images()`):

*   **`prompt` (Required):**  The text description of the image you want to generate.
*   **`number_of_images` (Optional):**  The number of images to generate.  Must be between 1 and 4 (inclusive).  Defaults to 4.
*   **`aspect_ratio` (Optional):**  Controls the aspect ratio of the output image.  Supported values:
    *   `"1:1"` (Square - default)
    *   `"3:4"`
    *   `"4:3"`
    *   `"9:16"`
    *   `"16:9"`
*   **`safety_filter_level` (Optional):**  Adjusts the intensity of safety filtering.  Options:
    *   `"BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE"`: Blocks content with low, medium, or high probability/severity of being unsafe.
    *   `"BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE"`: Blocks content with medium or high probability/severity.
    *   `"BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH"`: Blocks content with high probability/severity.
    *    *Note: For the initial GA launch, safety filters are NOT configurable.*
* **`person_generation`:** Allow the model to generate images with persons, values are:
    * `"DONT_ALLOW"`: Block generation of images of people.
    * `"ALLOW_ADULT"`: Generate images of adults, but not children. This is the default.
*   **Watermarking:**  All generated images include a non-visible digital SynthID watermark.

TEXT PROMPT LANGUAGE:

*   Currently, only English (`en`) is explicitly listed as supported for input text prompts.

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:

*   **Gemini Cookbook:**  The Gemini Cookbook contains a "Getting Started with Imagen" notebook for Python developers.  This is a great resource for hands-on learning.
* **Imagen prompt guide:** Provides guidance for the Imagen.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:

*   Imagen 3 is Google's most advanced text-to-image model, accessible through the Gemini API.
*   It offers significant improvements in image quality and text rendering.
*   The `generate_images()` function is used to create images from text prompts.
*   Understand the available parameters (`prompt`, `number_of_images`, `aspect_ratio`, `safety_filter_level`) to control the generation process.
* There is a notebook in the Gemini Cookbok to use Imagen.
